Story: 

Everyone was panicking. The kids knew they could not just stay in the Cafeteria with MSW, Charlie, and Gordie on 
the loose. They tiptoed past the sandwich bar and ran to the elevators. Liam, pizza in hand, repeatedly pushed the 
down button on the elevator panel, but Nicky quickly interjected.

"Are you serious? You want to take the elevator and take the chance of getting stuck in the elevator or trapped by
the zombies??" Nicky questioned.

The kids looked at each other, and, while Liam finished off his pizza, they ran towards the staircase and down the steps
toward the lobby.

"Ahhh" screamed Eliana as she flew back up the stairs.

"What? Are you ok?" Jack asked, oblivious to the flood of zombies marching slowly up the stairs.

As the rest of the kids saw the zombies, they all screamed and started scrambling away, except for Dillon and Makoto 
who immediately started replanning now that they could no longer escape the building. Then they whipped around and
took the steps, two at a time, until they were so out of breath they could not continue. The kids found themselves on 
the 11th floor where they quickly tried to come up with a new course of action.

"Ok. So we will be trapped here soon because the zombies are slowly infiltrating every floor of the school" exclaimed
Andrew.

"But nobody freak out, we have an advantage because we know the school much better than the zombies" cried Dillon.
"Obviously!!" Zach said, as he slowly shook his head.

Suddenly the floor cracked and a rotten hand lunged out, grabbing Zach by his ankle. 

The zombie dragged Zach toward its mouth and proceeded to take a chunk out of his leg. Always a quick thinker in
these sorts of situations, Dillon took the 4 foot machete off of his back and hacked off the better part of Zach's
lower leg. 

"Oh no!" said Zach melodramatically, my basketball career is ruined! 
"Who cares lets go!!" said other Ben, hiding panic. Dillon helped Zach up and then turned to the rest of the kids who 
were all horrified.
"Is anyone missing?" questioned Dillon.
"I think that everyone who was with us before is here." says Makoto. 
"Ok so everyone lets move into the dance studio. Lets hope it will be harder for the zombies to get to use there
because of the dance floor." stated Devin.

The group of kids all ran into the dance studio. Eliana, who was standing towards the back of the studio, began shaking
and turned white. 

"What happened?" asked Dillon.
"Um...I think I hear something over there" said Eliana as she pointed in the direction of where Zach had gotten
most of his leg chopped off.

From across the hall, they hear people talking and the sounds of heavy things being moved, and then suddenly it got quiet.
Cautiously Nicky edged towards the sounds. Everyone followed, tiptoeing and ready to bolt if there were zombies. 
After an intense moment of suspence, they look into the room that the sounds had been coming from. 

"Oh!! There you guys are! I thought you guys were gone for good!" said ________.
